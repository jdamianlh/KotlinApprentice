/*
       1. Create a constant named range and set it equal to a range starting at 1 and
       ending with 10 inclusive. Write a for loop which iterates over this range and
       prints the square of each number.
       2. Write a for loop to iterate over the same range as in the exercise above and print
       the square root of each number. Youâ€™ll need to type convert your loop constant.
       3. Above, you saw a for loop which iterated over only the even rows like so:
            var sum = 0
            for (row in 0 until 8) {
                if (row % 2 == 0) {
                continue
                }
                for (column in 0 until 8) {
                sum += row * column
                }
            }
    Change this to use a step clause on the first for loop to skip even rows instead of
    using continue. Check that the sum is 448 as in the initial example

fun ForLoops(){
    val range = 1..10

    for(r in range) {
        println(sqrt(r.toDouble()))
    }

    var sum = 0
    for (row in 1 until 8 step 2) {

        for (column in 0 until 8) {
            sum += row * column
        }
    }
    println(sum)
}
